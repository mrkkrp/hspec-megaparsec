The package is the recommended library for testing
[`Megaparsec`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) parsers with
with [`Hspec`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec). As of Megaparsec
5.1.0, its test suite is re-written with Hspec and this package with a few
ad-hoc helpers.

Consult the Haddocks for usage, which should be trivial. Also see test suite
of this package or [Megaparsec test
suite](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec/tree/master/tests).
